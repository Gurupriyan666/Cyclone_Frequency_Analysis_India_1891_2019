🌪️ Cyclone & Depression Frequency Analysis in India (1891–2019)

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical cyclone and tropical depression frequency in India from 1891 to 2019 using Python. The goal is to understand long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and decade-wise variations that can support climate research, disaster preparedness, and policy planning.
The analysis is performed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and data visualization.
